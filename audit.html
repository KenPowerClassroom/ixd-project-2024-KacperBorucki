        Is it visually appealing?
        Does it have sound and animation to capture the users attention?
        Does it have a good balance of challenge and reward?
    </td>
    <td>Kahoot is a very engaging application that focuses heavily on visuals which work well. It features a lot of sounds and animations to capture attention of users.
        There are no "rewards" in kahoot other than getting a temporary trophy when in 1st, 2nd or 3rd place.
        (7/10)
    </td>
    <td>Typing.com is a very engaging website that uses gamification elements such as levels to reward and motivate players.
        The app is designed very friendily and offers a variety of exercises with a good balance between reward and challenge.

    <td>Progress tracking: How well does the app track the user's progress?
        Does it provide feedback and recommendations to help users improve their performance?
        Does it use data to personalize the learning experience?
    </td>
    <td>Kahoot does not track any user progress after a "game" has been finished. All player points are reset with every new "game" that is started.
        There is little to no feedback or recommendations in Kahoot that help the user.
        Kahoot can show you similar content based on what you've played before so there is a little personal data usage.
        (2/10)
    </td>
    <td>This app is really good at keeping track of the users progress.
        There are a lot of features in this app that allow users to earn badges and xp for each course they complete.
        It does provide feedback such as suggestions for the user to re-learn old courses if their scores are dropping.

    </td>
    <td>I think that Kahoot is very user-friendly and can be used by most ages to learn.
        I think Kahoot can be difficult to navigate and use at times.
        It does not have clear instructions or prompts on how to use it.
        I do think the interface is well designed but it lacks prompts.
